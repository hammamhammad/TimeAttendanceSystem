## 🌟 Innovative Features

### 1. Auto-Calculating Working Days
The Remote Work Request form automatically calculates working days (weekdays only) as the user selects dates:
```typescript
// Calculates working days between dates
private getWorkingDaysBetween(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): number {
  let count = 0;
  const current = new Date(startDate);

  while (current <= endDate) {
    const dayOfWeek = current.getDay();
    // Count only weekdays (Monday-Friday)
    if (dayOfWeek !== 0 && dayOfWeek !== 6) {
      count++;
    }
    current.setDate(current.getDate() + 1);
  }

  return count;
}
```

**User Experience:**
- User selects: Start Date = Monday, End Date = Friday
- System displays: "Working Days: 5 days (weekdays only)"
- Updates instantly as dates change

### 2. Live Form Updates
Both forms update in real-time:
- Character counters update as user types
- Working days recalculate on date change
- Validation errors show/hide dynamically

### 3. File Attachment Support
Excuse requests support file attachments:
- Accepts: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG
- Shows file preview before upload
- Displays file size
- Allows removal before submission
- Download link in details view

### 4. Smart Status Management
Actions available based on status:
- **Pending:** Edit, Cancel
- **Approved:** View only
- **Rejected:** View only
