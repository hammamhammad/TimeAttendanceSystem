- Understand the project structure and follow this structure before implementing any new feature
- Split the new components into three files (ts,html,css)
- Compile the project and confirm no compilation errors before going to the next step
- always give me the plan for implementation, then wait for me to confirm
- use Coravel package for all background jobs
- Always drop the DB and create it from the models and seed data
- always run the frontend/4200 and backend/http/5099
- allways use NotificationService and ConfirmationService in the frontend
- always use DataTableComponent for the tables in the frontend
- Always use the new Angular template syntax @if / @for instead of legacy structural directives, to maintain consistency with the latest Angular standards
- When applying the database migration, ensure that all existing data in the database is preserved
