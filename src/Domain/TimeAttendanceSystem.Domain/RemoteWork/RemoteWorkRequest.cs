/// Similar to vacation requests - individual, date-based requests managed by HR.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Remote Work Request Features:
/// - Individual employee requests (not bulk)
/// - Date range based (StartDate to EndDate)
/// - Status workflow (Pending â†’ Approved/Rejected/Cancelled)
/// - Policy-based quota validation and tracking
/// - Affects attendance calculations when approved
///
/// Business Rules:
/// - StartDate cannot be in the past (except for ongoing requests)
/// - EndDate must be after or equal to StartDate
/// - Request dates must not fall within blackout periods
/// - Must comply with policy quota limits (weekly/monthly/yearly)
/// - Must respect consecutive days restrictions
/// - Cannot overlap with other approved requests for same employee
/// - Working days count excludes weekends and holidays
///
/// Status Workflow:
/// - Pending: Awaiting HR approval
/// - Approved: Active and affects attendance
/// - Rejected: Declined by HR with reason
/// - Cancelled: Cancelled by HR
///
/// Security Considerations:
/// - Branch-scoped through employee relationship
/// - Permission-based operations for request management
/// - Audit trail through CreatedByUserId and approval fields
/// - Soft delete support through BaseEntity
