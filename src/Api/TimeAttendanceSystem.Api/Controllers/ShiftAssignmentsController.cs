/// <summary>
/// API controller for managing shift assignments with comprehensive CRUD operations.
/// Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting shift assignments
/// with support for multi-level assignments (Employee, Department, Branch).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Controller Features:
/// - RESTful API design with standard HTTP verbs
/// - Comprehensive request validation and error handling
/// - Pagination support for list operations
/// - Advanced filtering capabilities
/// - Authorization and permission checking
/// - Audit trail integration for all operations
/// - Multi-tenant support through proper scoping
///
/// Endpoint Overview:
/// - GET /api/v1/shift-assignments - List assignments with filtering
/// - GET /api/v1/shift-assignments/{id} - Get specific assignment details
/// - POST /api/v1/shift-assignments - Create new assignment
/// - PUT /api/v1/shift-assignments/{id} - Update existing assignment
/// - DELETE /api/v1/shift-assignments/{id} - Delete assignment
///
/// Security:
/// - All endpoints require authentication
/// - Permission-based access control for different assignment scopes
/// - Branch-scoped access for multi-tenant isolation
/// - Input validation and sanitization
/// - Audit logging for all operations
/// </remarks>
