/// <summary>
/// API controller for managing user authentication sessions.
/// Provides endpoints for session monitoring, management, and security control.
/// Implements session-based security features for multi-device user authentication.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Session Management Features:
/// - List all active sessions for authenticated user
/// - Terminate specific sessions remotely (security feature)
/// - Bulk termination of all sessions except current
/// - Device information tracking and display
/// - IP address monitoring for suspicious activity detection
/// 
/// Security Considerations:
/// - All endpoints require authentication (JWT token)
/// - Users can only manage their own sessions
/// - Session termination invalidates refresh tokens
/// - Audit logging tracks all session management actions
/// - Protection against session hijacking through device fingerprinting
/// 
/// Use Cases:
/// - User security dashboard showing active devices
/// - Remote logout from compromised devices  
/// - Security incident response (terminate all sessions)
/// - Device management and monitoring
/// - Suspicious activity investigation
