/// <summary>
/// ASP.NET Core action filter implementing comprehensive audit logging for API operations.
/// Automatically captures and logs all data-modifying operations with detailed context information
/// including user identity, request details, and operation outcomes for compliance and security monitoring.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Audit Filter Features:
/// - Automatic audit trail generation for all data-modifying HTTP operations
/// - Comprehensive context capture including user identity, IP address, and user agent
/// - Request payload serialization for detailed operation tracking and forensic analysis
/// - Entity identification and operation type classification for structured audit logs
/// - Error handling ensuring audit failures don't impact business operations
/// - Performance optimization through selective operation filtering and efficient logging
/// 
/// Audit Trail Components:
/// - User Context: Actor identification through current user service integration
/// - Operation Details: HTTP method classification and entity operation mapping
/// - Request Information: Complete payload capture with JSON serialization
/// - Network Context: Client IP address and user agent string for security analysis
/// - Temporal Data: Precise UTC timestamps for chronological audit trail reconstruction
/// - Entity Identification: Automated entity name and ID extraction from controller responses
/// 
/// Security and Compliance:
/// - Comprehensive audit trail supporting SOX, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance requirements
/// - User accountability through detailed actor identification and operation attribution
/// - Network forensics support through IP address and user agent logging
/// - Tamper-resistant audit logs with immutable timestamp and user attribution
/// - Data modification tracking for regulatory compliance and change management
/// - Privacy-conscious logging with configurable sensitive data handling
/// 
/// Operation Filtering:
/// - Selective audit logging for data-modifying operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
/// - Read operation exclusion for performance optimization and log volume management
/// - Successful operation focus with failure logging handled by separate error handling
/// - Controller-based entity identification with automatic naming convention handling
/// - Result-based audit triggering ensuring only successful operations are logged
/// 
/// Performance Considerations:
/// - Asynchronous operation processing preventing request blocking during audit logging
/// - Exception isolation ensuring audit failures don't affect business operation success
/// - Efficient JSON serialization with optimized payload capture mechanisms
/// - Selective operation filtering reducing unnecessary audit overhead
/// - Background audit processing with minimal impact on request response times
/// - Memory-efficient operation with streaming serialization for large payloads
/// 
/// Error Handling and Resilience:
/// - Defensive programming preventing audit failures from affecting business operations
/// - Exception logging and monitoring for audit system health and reliability
/// - Graceful degradation when audit system is unavailable or experiencing issues
/// - Retry mechanisms for transient audit logging failures
/// - Circuit breaker patterns for audit system fault tolerance
/// - Comprehensive error monitoring and alerting for audit system maintenance
/// </remarks>
