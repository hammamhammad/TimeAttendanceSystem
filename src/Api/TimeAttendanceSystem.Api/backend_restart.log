      The foreign key property 'Employee.DepartmentId1' was created in shadow state because a conflicting property with the simple name 'DepartmentId' exists in the entity type, but is either not mapped, is already used for another relationship, or is incompatible with the associated primary key type.

      The 'ApprovalStatus' property 'ApprovalStatus' on entity type 'EmployeeExcuse' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'ApprovalStatus' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-default-values for more information.
warn: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Model.Validation[20601]
      The 'ShiftAssignmentStatus' property 'Status' on entity type 'ShiftAssignment' is configured with a database-generated default, but has no configured sentinel value. The database-generated default will always be used for inserts when the property has the value '0', since this is the CLR default for the 'ShiftAssignmentStatus' type. Consider using a nullable type, using a nullable backing field, or setting the sentinel value for the property to ensure the database default is used when, and only when, appropriate.
