/// <summary>
/// Command handler for secure password change operations with comprehensive validation and security enforcement.
/// Implements password policy compliance, history tracking, and security audit logging for user account management.
/// Provides robust password change processing with multi-layer validation and organizational security controls.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Password Change Security Features:
/// - Current password verification preventing unauthorized changes
/// - Password history tracking preventing recent password reuse
/// - Password complexity validation through policy enforcement
/// - Security audit logging for compliance and monitoring
/// - Account status validation ensuring active user changes only
/// - Immediate session security updates after password change
/// 
/// Password Policy Enforcement:
/// - Current password verification for authorization security
/// - New password complexity requirements validation
/// - Password history prevention (last 5 passwords blocked)
/// - Password uniqueness validation preventing current password reuse
/// - Minimum password age and change frequency controls
/// - Organizational password policy compliance checking
/// 
/// Security Validation Process:
/// 1. User authentication and authorization verification
/// 2. Account status validation (active, not locked)
/// 3. Current password verification for security authorization
/// 4. New password policy compliance validation
/// 5. Password history checking preventing reuse
/// 6. Secure password hashing with cryptographic salt
/// 7. Database update with audit trail creation
/// 8. Security event logging for monitoring
/// 
/// User Account Security:
/// - Authentication state validation before password changes
/// - Account lockout status checking preventing locked user changes
/// - Password change authorization through current password verification
/// - Mandatory password change flag reset after successful change
/// - User session security updates after password modification
/// - Cross-device security notifications for password changes
/// 
/// Organizational Compliance:
/// - Password policy enforcement for regulatory compliance
/// - Audit trail creation for security monitoring and forensics
/// - Change tracking for compliance reporting and user activity
/// - Security event logging for incident response capabilities
/// - Historical password tracking for policy violation detection
/// - Administrative oversight through comprehensive audit logs
/// 
/// Performance and Security Optimization:
/// - Single database transaction for atomicity and consistency
/// - Efficient password hash verification with timing attack resistance
/// - Optimized password history queries with limited lookback
/// - Cryptographically secure password hashing (PBKDF2-SHA256)
/// - Minimal database operations for high-performance password changes
/// - Async processing for non-blocking user experience
/// 
/// Integration with Security Infrastructure:
/// - Password service integration for secure hashing operations
/// - Current user context integration for audit trail accuracy
/// - Database context integration for transactional consistency
/// - Security event logging integration for monitoring systems
/// - Session management integration for immediate security updates
