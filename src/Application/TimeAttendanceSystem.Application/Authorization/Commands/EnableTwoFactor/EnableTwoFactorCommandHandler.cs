/// <summary>
/// Command handler for enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for user accounts with comprehensive security setup.
/// Implements TOTP-based two-factor authentication with backup codes, QR code generation, and security audit logging
/// for enhanced account security and compliance with enterprise authentication standards.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Two-Factor Authentication Features:
/// - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) implementation following RFC 6238 standards
/// - Cryptographically secure secret key generation for TOTP algorithm
/// - QR code generation for easy authenticator app setup and user onboarding
/// - Backup code generation for account recovery and emergency access scenarios
/// - Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring and compliance requirements
/// - State validation preventing duplicate 2FA enablement and ensuring data integrity
/// 
/// Security Implementation:
/// - TOTP secret key generation using cryptographically secure random number generation
/// - Base32 encoding for secret key compatibility with authenticator applications
/// - Multiple backup codes generation for redundant recovery options
/// - Secure storage of 2FA credentials with proper encryption considerations
/// - Audit trail creation for security event monitoring and forensic analysis
/// - User authentication validation ensuring authorized 2FA enablement only
/// 
/// TOTP Standard Compliance:
/// - RFC 6238 Time-Based One-Time Password algorithm implementation
/// - SHA-1 hash algorithm for compatibility with standard authenticator apps
/// - 30-second time window for TOTP code validity and synchronization
/// - 6-digit numeric codes for user-friendly authentication experience
/// - Counter drift handling for clock synchronization issues
/// - Standard URI format for QR codes supporting multiple authenticator apps
/// 
/// Backup Code Management:
/// - Cryptographically secure backup code generation with sufficient entropy
/// - Multiple backup codes (typically 10) for comprehensive recovery options
/// - One-time use backup codes with automatic invalidation after usage
/// - Secure storage with usage tracking and audit trail maintenance
/// - Recovery workflow integration for account access restoration
/// - Administrative override capabilities for emergency account recovery
/// 
/// User Experience Optimization:
/// - QR code generation for seamless authenticator app configuration
/// - Clear backup code presentation with usage instructions
/// - Comprehensive setup response with all necessary authentication data
/// - Error handling with informative messages for troubleshooting
/// - Graceful failure handling ensuring system stability under error conditions
/// - Integration with user interface for smooth onboarding experience
/// 
/// Enterprise Security Integration:
/// - Comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security monitoring
/// - Integration with organizational security policies and procedures
/// - Multi-tenant support with proper user scope isolation
/// - Role-based access control for 2FA management operations
/// - Security event integration with SIEM systems and monitoring tools
/// - Compliance with enterprise authentication standards and regulations

    /// 3. Secret Generation: Creates cryptographically secure TOTP secret key
    /// 4. QR Code Generation: Creates authenticator app compatible QR code URI
    /// 5. Backup Code Generation: Creates multiple recovery codes for emergency access
    /// 6. Database Persistence: Stores 2FA credentials and backup codes securely
    /// 7. Audit Logging: Records security event for monitoring and compliance
    /// 8. Response Assembly: Returns complete 2FA setup data to client application
    /// 
    /// Security Validations:
    /// - User authentication state verification before 2FA operations
    /// - Duplicate 2FA enablement prevention maintaining data integrity
    /// - Secure credential generation using cryptographically strong algorithms
    /// - Comprehensive audit trail creation for security monitoring

    /// Error Scenarios:
    /// - Unauthenticated user attempts with appropriate error messaging

    /// - Already enabled 2FA prevention with informative user feedback
    /// - Database operation failures with proper transaction rollback
    /// - Service dependencies failures with graceful error handling
