/// <summary>
/// Command handler for soft-deleting vacation types in the Time Attendance System.
/// Implements comprehensive validation, business rule enforcement, and referential integrity checks
/// for safe vacation type deletion with audit trail generation and data preservation.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Handler Responsibilities:
/// - Input validation ensuring valid vacation type ID
/// - Entity existence validation with proper error handling
/// - Business rule enforcement preventing deletion of active vacation types
/// - Referential integrity validation to protect related data
/// - Soft delete implementation preserving audit trails and historical data
/// - Database persistence with proper error handling and rollback capabilities
/// - Audit trail generation for compliance and change tracking
///
/// Validation Stages:
/// 1. Input Validation: Verify vacation type ID is valid and positive
/// 2. Entity Existence: Confirm vacation type exists and is accessible
/// 3. Usage Validation: Check for existing vacation records using this type
/// 4. Business Rule Validation: Apply organizational deletion policies
/// 5. Soft Delete Execution: Mark entity as deleted while preserving data
///
/// Business Rule Enforcement:
/// - Cannot delete vacation types with active vacation records
/// - Cannot delete vacation types with pending vacation requests
/// - Cannot delete vacation types assigned to employee profiles
/// - Maintains referential integrity across all related entities
/// - Preserves historical data for compliance and reporting purposes
///
/// Error Handling:
/// - Comprehensive error categorization for appropriate HTTP response codes
/// - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting and user feedback
/// - Graceful handling of concurrency conflicts and database constraints
/// - Proper exception translation to Result pattern responses
/// - Entity not found handling with user-friendly messages
///
/// Performance Considerations:
/// - Efficient entity retrieval with single database query
/// - Optimized referential integrity checks through targeted queries
/// - Minimal database round trips through batched validation
/// - Async operations throughout for non-blocking request processing
/// - Proper disposal of database resources and transaction management
/// </remarks>
