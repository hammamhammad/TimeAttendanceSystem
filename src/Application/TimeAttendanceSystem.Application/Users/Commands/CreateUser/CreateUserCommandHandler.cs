/// - Administrative privilege handling with system-wide access controls
/// - User account lifecycle management with proper initialization and activation
/// 
/// Security Implementation:
/// - Username and email uniqueness validation preventing duplicate accounts
/// - Cryptographically secure password hashing with 10,000 PBKDF2 iterations
/// - Role existence validation preventing assignment of non-existent permissions
/// - Branch existence validation ensuring valid organizational assignments
/// - Administrative context awareness for system-wide vs. tenant-scoped operations

/// - Tenant-specific role assignments with organizational boundary enforcement
/// - Hierarchical permission validation ensuring proper organizational structure
/// - Cross-branch administrative access control for enterprise management scenarios
/// - Data isolation enforcement through branch scope validation and assignment
/// 
/// Role-Based Access Control:
/// - Dynamic role assignment during user creation with validation
/// - Role existence verification preventing invalid permission assignments
/// - Hierarchical role structure support for complex organizational requirements
/// - Permission inheritance through role assignments and organizational structure
/// - Administrative role handling with elevated privilege management
/// - Role scope validation ensuring proper permission boundaries and constraints
/// 
/// Data Integrity and Validation:
/// - Comprehensive input validation with business rule enforcement
/// - Database constraint validation preventing data inconsistency
/// - Transaction management ensuring atomic user creation operations
/// - Error handling with informative messages for troubleshooting and user guidance
/// - Audit trail preparation for compliance and change tracking requirements
/// - Data consistency checks across related entities and organizational structures
/// 
/// Enterprise Integration:
/// - Welcome email preparation for user onboarding and initial setup
/// - Integration with organizational identity management systems

    /// 4. Branch Validation: Confirms all branch scopes exist and are accessible
    /// 5. Password Security: Generates secure password hash using PBKDF2-SHA256
    /// 6. User Creation: Creates user entity with all validated data and security credentials
    /// 7. Role Assignment: Associates user with validated roles for access control
    /// 8. Branch Assignment: Configures organizational scope for multi-tenant isolation
    /// 9. Database Persistence: Commits all changes in atomic transaction
    /// 10. Response Generation: Returns user ID for client application integration
